# LocalFlow

LocalFlow is a minimalist transcription application inspired by [Flow](https://wisprflow.ai), but using local models.

Built with Electron and a Python backend. The audio is transcribed using OpenAI's Whisper model and then formatted using llama3.2. The application is designed to be used offline and locally.

Requires CUDA and Ollama.
